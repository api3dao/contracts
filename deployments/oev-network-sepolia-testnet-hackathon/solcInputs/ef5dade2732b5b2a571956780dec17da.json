The Api3Market contract is the on-chain portion\n/// of this system.\n/// Api3Market enables API3 to predetermine the decisions related to its data\n/// feed services (such as the curation of data feed sources or subscription\n/// prices) and publish them on-chain. This streamlines the intergation flow,\n/// as it allows the users to initiate subscriptions immediately, without\n/// requiring any two-way communication with API3. Furthermore, this removes\n/// the need for API3 to have agents operating in the meatspace gathering order\n/// details, quoting prices and reviewing payments, and allows all such\n/// operations to be cryptographically secured with a multi-party scheme in an\n/// end-to-end manner.\n/// @dev The user is strongly recommended to use the API3 Market frontend while\n/// interacting with this contract, mostly because doing so successfully\n/// requires some amount of knowledge of other API3 contracts. Specifically,\n/// Api3Market requires the data feed for which the subscription is being\n/// purchased to be \"readied\", the correct Merkle proofs to be provided, and\n/// enough payment to be made. The API3 Market frontend will fetch the\n/// appropriate Merkle proofs, create a multicall transaction that will ready\n/// the data feed before making the call to buy the subscription, and compute\n/// the amount to be sent that will barely allow the subscription to be\n/// purchased.

API3 holds OEV auctions for its data feed services and forwards\n/// the proceeds to the respective user dApps. OevAuctionHouse is the platform\n/// that OEV searchers can bid on data feed updates that satisfy specific\n/// conditions, and report that they have fulfilled the updates that they are\n/// awarded. Refer to Api3ServerV1.sol for how the awarded updates are to be\n/// fulfilled and how the beneficiaries can withdraw the auction proceeds.\n/// @dev OevAuctionHouse is intended to be deployed on a single chain, while\n/// Api3ServerV1 (the API3 data feed contract) is deployed on the chains that\n/// the respective user dApps are deployed on. An OEV searcher bids on an\n/// update at OevAuctionHouse, gets the larger of the collateral and protocol\n/// fee locked up at OevAuctionHouse when they are awarded the update, fulfill\n/// the update and pay their bid amount at Api3ServerV1, and report back to\n/// OevAuctionHouse to have their locked funds released and the protocol fee\n/// charged. This flow implies the need for a certain kind of a cross-chain\n/// oracle functionality (to check if the awarded update is fulfilled), which\n/// is provided by the auctioneer role in this contract. The same auctioneer\n/// role is also assigned to award the individual updates to the winning bids.\n/// This means that the trustlessness of the auctions is limited by the\n/// trustlessness of the auctioneer implementation.
