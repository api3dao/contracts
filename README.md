> Contracts through which API3 services are delivered

This package provides the tools to integrate data feeds that can be found at the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org). The typical workflow is as follows:

1. Purchase data feed subscriptions and get the respective proxy addresses at the API3 Market
2. Use the proxy address computation utility function provided by this package (`computeCommunalApi3ReaderProxyV1Address()`) to validate the proxy addresses being used
3. Use the proxy contract interfaces provided by this package in the reader contract, as demonstrated in https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-reader-example

A more complete list of what this package includes is as follows:

- All contracts that facilitate API3 data feed services, including OEV auctions
- `@typechain/ethers-v6` typings of these contracts
- Addresses of the API3 deployments of these contracts
- Proxy address computation utility functions

## Security

We have conducted 10+ audits of our contracts and their off-chain components.
Below are the reports of the ones that are directly related to the contracts in this repo (or in some cases, earlier versions of them).

## Developer instructions

Install the dependencies and build

```sh
pnpm i && pnpm build
```

Test the contracts, get coverage and gas reports

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm test:extended
# Outputs to `./coverage`
pnpm test:coverage
# Outputs to `gas_report`
pnpm test:gas
```

Verify that the vendor contracts are identical to the ones from their respective packages.

```sh
pnpm verify-vendor-contracts
```

Check the local files containing metadata

```sh
pnpm check
```

Verify the deployments and validate their current state

```sh
# on all chains
pnpm verify-deployments
# or a single chain
NETWORK=ethereum pnpm verify-deployments
# on all chains
pnpm validate-deployments
# or a single chain
NETWORK=ethereum pnpm validate-deployments
```
