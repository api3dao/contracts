> Contracts through which Api3 services are delivered

This package provides the tools to integrate data feeds that can be found at the [Api3 Market](https://market.api3.org). The typical workflow is as follows:

1. Purchase data feed subscriptions and get the respective proxy addresses at the Api3 Market
2. Use the proxy address computation utility function provided by this package (`computeCommunalApi3ReaderProxyV1Address()`) to validate the proxy addresses being used
3. Use the proxy contract interfaces provided by this package in the reader contract, as demonstrated in https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-reader-example

A more complete list of what this package includes is as follows:

- All contracts that facilitate Api3 data feed services, including OEV auctions
- `@typechain/ethers-v6` typings of these contracts
- Addresses of the Api3 deployments of these contracts
- Proxy address computation utility functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The most common type of change would be adding or updating a chain. This can be done by creating or editing the relevant JSON file in the `data/chains/` directory.

If any changes are made to chains, you will need to "regenerate" the chains. This will compile all of the JSON files into a single TypeScript file for projects to import. Please check the [Developer instructions](#developer-instructions) section for more information on how to do this.

The list of TypeScript chains is also validated against all of the list of JSON files to ensure that everything is in sync.

NOTE: You will not be able to push changes to chains without having regenerated the TypeScript chains.

## üíª Developer instructions

Install the dependencies and build

```sh
pnpm i && pnpm build
```

Test the contracts, get coverage and gas reports

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm test:extended
# Outputs to `./coverage`
pnpm test:coverage
# Outputs to `gas_report`
pnpm test:gas
```

Generate the latest `CHAINS` array and outputs the file to `src/generated/chains.ts`

```sh
pnpm generate:chains
```

Generate the latest `DAPPS` array and outputs the file to `src/generated/dapps.ts`

```sh
pnpm generate:dapps
```

Generate deployment addresses for all chains and outputs the file to `src/generated/deployments.ts`

```sh
pnpm generate:deployment-addresses
```

Generate all of the above files in one go

```sh
pnpm generate
```

Check the local files containing metadata

```sh
pnpm check
```

Verify that the vendor contracts are identical to the ones from their respective packages.

```sh
pnpm verify-vendor-contracts
```

Verify the deployments and validate their current state

```sh
# on all chains
pnpm verify-deployments
# or a single chain
NETWORK=ethereum pnpm verify-deployments
# on all chains
pnpm validate-deployments
# or a single chain
NETWORK=ethereum pnpm validate-deployments
```

## üìñ API

```

### deploymentAddresses

An object that contains the deployment addresses of all contracts on all chains. The keys are contract names and the values are objects where the keys are chain IDs and the values are the contract addresses.

```ts
import { deploymentAddresses } from '@api3/contracts';
console.log(deploymentAddresses);
/*
{
  "GnosisSafeWithoutProxy": {
    "1": "0x...",
    "10": "0x...",
    "56": "0x...",
    ...
  },
  "OwnableCallForwarder": {

    "0x...",
    "0x..."
  ]
}
*/
```

### unsafeComputeDappId

Computes the dApp ID for a given dApp alias and chain ID. This function is unsafe because it does not validate the inputs, so it should only be used when the inputs are guaranteed to be correct.

```ts
import { unsafeComputeDappId } from '@api3/contracts';
const dappId = unsafeComputeDappId('dtrinity', '252');
console.log(dappId);
/*
16210721173577624589952893185091679941657223823840386808143855919126917477566n
*/
```

### computeApi3ReaderProxyV1Address

Computes the Api3ReaderProxyV1 address for a given chain ID, dAPI name, dApp ID and metadata.

```ts
import { computeApi3ReaderProxyV1Address } from '@api3/contracts';
const address = computeApi3ReaderProxyV1Address(
  '1',
  'ETH/USD',
  '16210721173577624589952893185091679941657223823840386808143855919126917477566',
  '0x'

*/
```

### computeCommunalApi3ReaderProxyV1Address

Computes the Api3ReaderProxyV1 address being used by Api3 Market for a given dAPI name and chain ID.

```ts
import { computeCommunalApi3ReaderProxyV1Address } from '@api3/contracts';
const address = computeCommunalApi3ReaderProxyV1Address('1', 'ETH/USD');
console.log(address);
/*
0x5b0cf2b36a65a6BB085D501B971e4c102B9Cd473
*/
```

### computeDappSpecificApi3ReaderProxyV1Address

Computes the dApp-specific Api3ReaderProxyV1 address for a given dApp alias, chain ID, and dAPI name. This function is useful for retrieving the proxy address for a specific dApp on a specific chain.

```ts
import { computeDappSpecificApi3ReaderProxyV1Address } from '@api3/contracts';
const address = computeDappSpecificApi3ReaderProxyV1Address('dtrinity', '252', 'BTC/USD');
console.log(address);
/*
0x781d431031Ffd5273585e65F663699Dcb74834E6
*/
```

### hardhatConfig.networks()

Returns an object where the key is each chain's alias and the value is an object that can be used as the `networks` field of [`hardhat.config.js`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config).

The default `url` values can be overridden with chain specific environment variables. These environment variables take the form of `HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_${toUpperSnakeCase(chain.alias)}`. e.g. `HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_TESTNET`.

```ts
import { hardhatConfig } from '@api3/contracts';
console.log(hardhatConfig.networks());
/*
{
  "arbitrum-sepolia-testnet": {
      accounts: { mnemonic: '' },
      chainId: '421614',
      url: 'https://...',
  },
  ...
}
*/
```

### hardhatConfig.etherscan()

Returns an object where the key is each chain's alias and the value is an object that can be used as the `etherscan` field of [`hardhat.config.js`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config) (requires the [`hardhat-etherscan` plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan)).

NOTE: [hardhat-etherscan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan) requires us to use a dummy API key with Blockscout block explorer APIs. We use "DUMMY_VALUE" but it could have been anything else.

```ts
import { hardhatConfig } from '@api3/contracts';
console.log(hardhatConfig.etherscan());
/*
{
  apiKey: {
    'arbitrumSepolia': { ... }
  },
  customChains: [
    ...
  ]
}
*/
```

### hardhatConfig.getEnvVariableNames()

Returns an array of expected environment variable names for chains that have an API key required for the explorer. The array also includes a single `MNEMONIC` variable that can be used to configure all networks.

NOTE: Each `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY_` and `HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_` environment variable has the chain alias as a suffix, where the alias has been converted to upper snake case.

```ts
import { hardhatConfig } from '@api3/contracts';
console.log(hardhatConfig.getEnvVariableNames());
/*
[
  'MNEMONIC',
  'ETHERSCAN_API_KEY',
  'HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_APECHAIN_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_TESTNET',
  ...
]
*/
```

### viemConfig.chains()

Returns an array of chains in the format that [Viem](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) expects. Each Chain object can be used to [create a Viem public client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public#usage).

Additional `rpcUrls` values can (optionally) be added through the use of environment variables. These environment variables take the form of `API3_CHAINS_HTTP_RPC_URL_${toUpperSnakeCase(chain.alias)}`. If a matching environment variable is detected for a given chain, then it will be added to the `http` array of the `rpcUrls.environment` object. If no matching environment variable is detected, then the `http` array is left empty.

```ts
import { viemConfig } from '@api3/contracts';
console.log(viemConfig.chains());
/*
[
  {
    id: 421613,
    name: 'arbitrum-sepolia-testnet',
    network: 'arbitrum-sepolia-testnet',
    rpcUrls: { default: ..., public: ..., environment: ... }
    ...
  },
  ...
]
*/
```

### Types

Types exported in `src/types.ts` are generated from [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas, which are also used to validate each chain. Contract-related types generated by TypeChain can be found in `typechain-types` after building the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CLI

This CLI provides utility commands for calculating dApp IDs and retrieving important on-chain information such as proxy addresses.

### print-api3readerproxyv1-address

Prints the dApp-specific Api3ReaderProxyV1 address for a given dApp alias and chain ID.

```sh
npx @api3/contracts print-api3readerproxyv1-address --dapp-alias lendle --chain-id 5000 --dapi-name ETH/USD
```

### compute-dapp-id

Computes the dApp ID for a given dApp alias and chain ID.

```sh
npx @api3/contracts compute-dapp-id --dapp-alias mach-finance --chain-id 146
```

## üì¶ Releasing

Releasing new versions is handled automatically with [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Pull requests should include a changeset file before being merged.
These can be generated by running `pnpm changeset` and following the instructions. Once a new version is ready to be released, simply merge `main` into the `production`
branch. Changeset files will be consolidated into a single new version and that version released to npm.
