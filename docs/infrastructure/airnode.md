# Airnode

Airnode is a first-party oracle node designed to be operated by API providers.
The on-chain counterpart of Airnode is referred to as the [Airnode protocol](../specs/airnode-protocol.md).

[_Airnode feed_](https://github.com/api3dao/signed-api/tree/main/packages/airnode-feed) is an iteration on Airnode that is optimized to power data feeds.
It supports much larger bandwidth (i.e., number of data feeds that can be supported simultaneously) and lower latency.
