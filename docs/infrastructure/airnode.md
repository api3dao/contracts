# Airnode

Airnode is a first-party oracle node designed to be operated by API providers.
The on-chain counterpart of Airnode is referred to as the [Airnode protocol](../specs/airnode-protocol.md).

_Airnode feed_ is an iteration on Airnode that is optimized to power data feeds.
It supports much larger bandwidth (i.e., number of data feeds that can be supported simultaneously) and lower latency.
